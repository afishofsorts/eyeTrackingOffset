Algorithm to correct translationally offset eye tracking data for a simulated car driving study conducted by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. All work was done under the mentorship of Thomas Seacrist in Summer 2025 with funding received from the NSF. The actual data is missing due to patient confidentiality, meaning the program cannot run as is published.

The files are organized as follows. commandBank is an internal package to consolidate commonly used functions across the rest of the project. tests are individual sub-projects that were used for testing while building the program and are not necessary for implementation of the existing correction algorithm, only its research and refining. All individual test folders have their own saved folder to store data and figures. The saved folder in the parent file is for the actual original eye tracking data itself. Additionally, every python file has a header at the top briefly explaining its purpose.

Lastly, the main.py file reads and outputs whatever data is in the input file directory. This means the order of the outlier_list.npy will not be the same as other ID lists from other parts of the project.
